# Netlify deployment instructions:
# 1. In Netlify, create a new site from Git and select this repository.
# 2. Ensure the build command is set to "npm run build".
# 3. Set the publish directory to "app" so the built assets are served.
# 4. Trigger the deploy; Netlify will run the Tailwind build automatically.
